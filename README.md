# 📁 File-Handling

This project contains simple file handling programs written in **C++**, **Python**, and **Bash**.  
It helps beginners understand how to create, read, write, check, and delete files using different programming languages.

---

## 📂 Folders Overview

Each folder contains the same task written in all three languages:

```

File-Handling/
````
├── 1\_File\_Creation/          # Create a file and write text into it
├── 2\_File\_Reading/           # Read content from a file
├── 3\_File\_Appending/         # Add new text to the end of a file
├── 4\_File\_Existence\_Check/   # Check if a file exists or not
├── 5\_File\_Deletion/          # Delete a file
````
````

Inside every folder, you'll find:
- A `.cpp` file → for C++
- A `.py` file → for Python
- A `.sh` file → for Bash

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

### 🟦 C++ (.cpp files)

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o myprogram
./myprogram
````

> Example:

g++ file_create.cpp -o create
./create
```

---

### 🟨 Python (.py files)

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

> Example:

```bash
python3 file_read.py
```

---

### 🟩 Bash (.sh files)

```bash
chmod +x filename.sh
./filename.sh
```

> Example:

```bash
chmod +x file_delete.sh
./file_delete.sh
```
